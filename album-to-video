#the check for -f in there is because if the glob is empty it will just return itself as a literal string. you can turn that off using shopt -s nullglob but this is more posix
#${f@Q} is an esoteric thing that does escaped substitution. it's like a quoted substitituion. we need in in case the file name has a (single) quote character in it. man, the whole sh model of variables is bad. im past caring. i just accept it now.
