REM For some reason, the Windows c compiler, cl, is troublesome to run by itself, so we invoke this batch script that puts all the correct tools into scope, and then invoke the actual cl. This script named cl is hidden by the actual cl after a single invocation, so subsequent invocations of cl simply refer to the real cl. This script is super path-dependent. You can get the VS build tools from https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe , or perhaps https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools or https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools .
