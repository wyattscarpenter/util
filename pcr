#/bin/bash
#PCR: PERL CONTENT REPLACE
#applies regexes... the way I think it should be done
#apologies:
#you must have perl installed to use this
#typing eg pcr \n foo won't work, because the \ will escape in bash
# and therefore be a regular n by the time it gets to the program
#arguments:
#$1 is what is to be found
#$2 is what to replace $1 with
#$3 is the file on which to perform the operation
#outputs the modified file contents to stdout, you might want to pipe to sponge
perl -0777 -pe "s/$1/$2/g" < "$3"
