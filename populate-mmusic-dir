# this script copies music files from the current dir to a different dir
# and re-encodes non-mp3/m4as to be mp3s

# by default, this script does not clobber, in order to save time
# if you'd like to override this behavior, remove the "-n"s from the script below
# but it would likely be more prudent to simply rm the mp3 dir beforehand

# this script might take an hour or two to run, on my computer and collection

# this script does not copy images of any kind, to save space

#TODO: learn how bash params work and make this accept an output dir param?
