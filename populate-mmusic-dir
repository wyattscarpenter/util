# this script copies music files from the current dir to a different dir (specified as an argument, defaults to "../../mmusic/", you probably want to pass in /e/mmusic/ if you're me)
# and re-encodes non-mp3/m4as to be mp3s

# by default, this script does not clobber, in order to save time
# if you'd like to override this behavior, remove the "-n"s from mmusic-transfer
# but it would likely be more prudent to simply rm the mmusic dir beforehand

# this script might take an hour or two to run, on my computer and collection

# this script does not copy images of any kind, to save space

mdir=${1:-"../../mmusic"}/ # an extra slash is harmless but a missing one is bad

# it is not necessary to explicitly filter out these invalid files
# but it does speed up the process a bit, probably
