#This bash command will quine all its arguments; that is, it will print its argument string and then evaluate it (in bash) (it would probably work in plain sh as well).
#If run with no arguments, this command would ideally "quine" (ie, print out) the file or command it is being run by (making it the cheating self-rep command) â€” but I couldn't figure out a way to make that possible, so it doesn't do that.
