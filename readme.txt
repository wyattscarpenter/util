This is a collection of small shell scripts I have found useful. Some of them are VERY small, and are only here because I can never remember some particular command.

Each script is documented by comments in the script itself.

Some of these scripts have external dependencies; if the script gives you some error about some command not being found, you probably need to go install a dependency. Some common dependencies are imagemagick and ffmpeg.

Most of these scripts were written for Bash on Windows. So, a couple words of advice about that: as far as I can tell, you used to be allowed to invoke an exe from Bash for Windows without its extension, but this was later changed so you have to supply the extension ("command" vs "command.exe"). Thus sometimes these scripts do strange-looking things like call exes from a bash script. If you're on linux, you can probably remove the ".exe"s from these commands perfectly cromulently. Similarly, if you're on Bash for Windows and you have command.exe but the script is invoking command plain, then try tacking an exe. However, if you ARE on Bash for Windows, and you need to install a command, you have two options: install in bash using apt or similar, or install in windows. If you install in Bash, the command will have no exe extension. However, the packages are often rather out of date (this became a problem for me with ffmpeg) so you can also install them in windows, the regular way you install things in windows. If you install in windows, go to the place where the executable is (or move the executable to somewhere on your path, if need be) and create a copy (or symlink or hard link (but not windows shortcut)) of the executable without the ".exe" extension ("command.exe" becomes "command") (needless to say, you will need to have "View > File name extensions" turned on in the File Explorer to do this quickly). That way, you should be able to invoke either command or command.exe from Bash for Windows and have it work. (If I recall correctly, this trick used to not work, but it does now.)

This collection will probably be the most useful to you if you add this folder to your PATH. The best way for you to do this is to google "how to add directory to path" and then do it yourself. You can also try using the script add-pwd-to-path, but this makes only a half-hearted attempt at doing the right thing.

I consider these scripts too trivial to fall under copyright. However, I am not a lawyer, so if I do actually hold a copyright on these scripts, I release them into the public domain under CC0. See https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ for more information. Some of these scripts were written by other people, so I claim no ownership over those.

The name of this collection is a small joke, as "util" is generally regarded by programmers to be a terribly uninformative name for anything. This collection is dedicated to Jeremy Bentham, the inventor of usefulness.
