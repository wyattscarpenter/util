This is a collection of small shell scripts I have found useful. Some of them are VERY small, and are only here because I can never remember some particular command.

Some of these scripts have external dependencies; if the script gives you some error about some command not being found, you probably need to go install a dependency. Some common dependencies are imagemagick and ffmpeg.

Each script is documented by comments in the script itself.

This collection will probably be the most useful to you if you add this folder to your PATH. The best way for you to do this is to google "how to add directory to path" and then do it yourself. You can also try using the script add-pwd-to-path, but this makes only a half-hearted attempt at doing the right thing.

I consider these scripts too trivial to fall under copyright. However, I am not a lawyer, so if I do actually hold a copyright on these scripts, I release them into the public domain under CC0. See https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ for more information.

The name of this collection is a small joke, as "util" is generally regarded by programmers to be a terribly uninformative name for anything.
