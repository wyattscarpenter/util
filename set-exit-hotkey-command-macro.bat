REM This batch script sets cmd autorun to use doskey to make the character produced by crtl w () (represented on the command line as ^W or â†¨ if echoed) into the name of a macro that expands to exit. Therefore, if you input ctrl+w into a cmd window expecting to kill the window, you can hit enter to make it so.
REM Why doskey? Ideally, we would make a batch script called .bat for this command. Unfortunately, the character produced by ctrl w is not a valid filename in windows, I guess, so it can't be the name of a batch script, and so we have to use doskey macros.
REM Why autorun? Doskey macro setup does not persist between sessions so we have to tell the computer to set it up each time.
REM (Note that I tried, instead of the autorun method, putting this batch script in shell:startup, and that did not work.)

reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v Autorun /d "doskey  =exit"

REM also do powershell quit and ^W and ^D
REM it's for only the current user, because that's a very convenient command
REM the syntax here is complicated, but simpler ideas didn't work for me. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/74648083/ for my source on this.
REM incidentally, you can clear (delete completely) the current powershell profile file with `del $profile` in powershell. (it will probably run q.bat if you q after this, which is useless).
powershell "echo 'Invoke-Expression \"Function $([Char]4) { Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock { Exit } }\"' >> $profile"
powershell "echo 'Invoke-Expression \"Function  { Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock { Exit } }\"' >> $profile"
powershell "echo 'Invoke-Expression \"Function q { Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock { Exit } }\"' >> $profile"

REM by the way, if you're running this from powershell instead of cmd (first of all, the REMs have errored so far, I guess; and also the quoting was wrong on the powershell lines), then to use the updated profile run: . $profile
