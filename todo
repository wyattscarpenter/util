rg -i "\btodo\b" #This uses ripgrep. It could easily be modified to use ag, grep, or some other grep-like file text searcher. Although, the syntax is not always trivial to remember how to make exactly the same search command when going from one to the other! #Please note that this file will likely always catch itself in a search for the string it searches for, and that's fine, you just have to remember that that will happen.
