# This is utilrc, a file that sets up various aliases that I want, like bashrc. It's shell-agnostic to some extent. You should probably add . utilrc to your ~/.bashrc if you want to use this, or something.
# Fun fact: the "rc" in all these "rc" files stands for "run commands".

#aliases for mistyping "cd .."
