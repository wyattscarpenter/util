# This is utilrc, a file that sets up various aliases that I want, like bashrc. It's shell-agnostic to some extent. You should probably add . utilrc to your ~/.bashrc if you want to use this, or something.
# Fun fact: the "rc" in all these "rc" files stands for "run commands".

# Aliases for mistyping "cd .."
alias cd..='cd ..'
alias ..='cd ..'

# Alias that lets you exit the shell with the pseudo-command "q"
alias q=exit

# Make bash command prompt always show the status returned by the previously-run command.
# (The ⏎ doesn't display right in any text editor or terminal I have, but it's the unicode return symbol.)
