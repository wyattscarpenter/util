#you can scale DVDs to 720p for youtube.
#I used to use truly lossless crf 0 for this but it's just not worth the space. All the things I use this on are already rips.

# Experiment on a video that is I guess wider than 16:9 (Video resolution: 702x576) (In fact, 16/9 = 1.77..., 4/3 = 1.33..., 702/576 = 1.21875, 5/4 = 1.25)

#IDK what I would do if I needed to avoid FFMPEG (libx264) "height not divisible by 2" AND I didn't know which slot should have the -2 in it...
