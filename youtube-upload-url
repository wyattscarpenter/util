# This command just glues together youtube-dl and youtubeuploader to download videos and pipe them into youtube upload.
# Note that the video will be private, titled -, and have no description.
# This command MUST be run in from the directory that contains your client_secrets.json, and probably your request.token,
# if you don't have such files, follow the instructions on https://github.com/porjo/youtubeuploader .
# This command assumes that youtubeuploader.exe is on the path, but it can easily be replaced by ./youtubeuploader.exe or youtubeuploader or ./youtubeuploader or what-have-you
youtube-dl.exe  "$@" -o - | youtubeuploader.exe -filename -
